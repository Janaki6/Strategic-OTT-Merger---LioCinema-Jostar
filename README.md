ðŸš€ Transforming Indiaâ€™s OTT Landscape: LioCinema + Jotstar Merger! ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“¡

âœ¨ "One Platform, Endless Stories â€“ Your Ultimate Entertainment Destination!" âœ¨

ðŸ“¢ Excited to share my submission for CodeBasics Resume Project Challenge #14! ðŸŽ‰

LioCinema & Jotstar are merging to create Indiaâ€™s most powerful OTT platform, combining:

âœ… LioCinemaâ€™s vast subscriber base & regional dominance ðŸŽ¥

âœ… Jotstarâ€™s premium content library & strong engagement ðŸ“º

As a data analyst, I evaluated user engagement, content consumption, and subscriber behavior by integrating data, identifying trends, and assessing platform performance. These insights will help optimize content offerings, improve user experience, and reduce churn, ensuring a successful merger.
